# LSI-UNIX
This is my personal copy of LSI-UNIX that I have been working on recently. It contains a few modifications from the original source, but is also faithful to it. The kernel is 10KW in size, and adds back a number of features from UNIX v6. The current system setup can compile its kernel and all user programs locally.
